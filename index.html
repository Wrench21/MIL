                                <p> Hi people I’m Alfie M. Agustin currently an ICT Student my friends call me
                                    fie all the time and I'am 18 years old my birthday is October 3 2004 I like
                                    listening to music and
                                    my favorite colors are white, black, red, orange and My favorite food is Kare-kare.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Self-Reflective Essay</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Overall, my experience taking the course was challenging but also very rewarding.
                                    One of the biggest struggles I faced was trying to keep up with the pace of the
                                    class. The material covered was quite dense and there were a lot of concepts to take
                                    in. I found myself constantly studying and reviewing the material outside of class
                                    in order to keep up.

                                    However, I was able to overcome this struggle by actively participating in class
                                    discussions and asking for help from the teacher when needed. Maam cano was very
                                    approachable and always willing to provide extra support and guidance. Additionally,
                                    I found that working with my classmates on group projects helped me to better
                                    understand the material and solidify my understanding.

                                    The impact of MIL on me as a student was significant. Not only did I gain a deeper
                                    understanding of the subject matter, but I also developed important skills such as
                                    critical thinking, problem-solving and effective communication. I appreciate Ma'aam
                                    cano's teaching approach which emphasizes active learning and collaboration, it
                                    helped me to be more engaged in the class and made the learning experience more
                                    enjoyable. In terms of feedback, I would say that Ma'aam cano was able to create a
                                    positive and inclusive learning environment, and the teaching strategies were
                                    effective in helping me to understand the material. Overall, I am grateful for the
                                    opportunity to take this course and for the valuable knowledge and skills that I
                                    have gained as a result.

                                        <p>As the border between physical and digital gets more permeable, a new kind
                                            of literacy emerges. And that literacy is built on a foundation of code
                                            whether it's
                                            the code of letters and words, or the code of bits and algorithms.</p>
